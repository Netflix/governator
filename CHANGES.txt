1.0.2 - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
=========================
* Integrated hierarchy graphing. See the wiki for details:
https://github.com/Netflix/governator/wiki/Grapher-Integration

* There's an edge case that results in a ClassNotFoundException when Governator
reflects on a class to find annotated methods. Governator now catches these and logs
an error instead of stopping the app.

1.0.1 - November 28, 2012
=========================
* Issue 27: Add support for auto binding Guice modules. Modules can now be marked
@AutoBindSingleton and they will get automatically installed.

* By default, @AutoBindSingleton binds to the class that has the annotation. You can
now set the value to any base class/interface that you want to bind to. You can bind to
generic base classes/interfaces by specifying the raw type (i.e.
@AutoBindSingleton(List.class) for List<String>).
