1.0.1 - xxxxxxxxxxxxx
=====================
* Issue 27: Add support for auto binding Guice modules. Modules can now be marked
@AutoBindSingleton and they will get automatically installed.

* By default, @AutoBindSingleton binds to the class that has the annotation. You can
now set the value to any base class/interface that you want to bind to. You can bind to
generic base classes/interfaces by specifying the raw type (i.e.
@AutoBindSingleton(List.class) for List<String>).
